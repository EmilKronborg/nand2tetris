# Assembler
The assembler is written using the suggested modules and APIs by the authors of the course. It could probably be written cleaner, but I valued readability. To translate `prog.asm` into `prog.hack` call the assembler like so:

```sh
$ python3 assembler.py prog.asm
```

The assembler is tested on all the given programs using python version 3.10.4.
