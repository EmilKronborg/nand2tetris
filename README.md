# Nand2tetris

The software and my solutions for the [Nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course. To run the software, Java 11 is required. If you get a white screen when running `HardwareSimulator.sh`, you need to export the following envinronment variable `$ export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1`.
